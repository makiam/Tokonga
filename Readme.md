### Scripts and Plugins Manager

This plugin provides tools and a User Interface to manage Add-ons to
[Art Of Illusion.](https://.github.com/ArtOfIllusion/ArtOfIllusion)

Plugins and scripts can be downloaded from compatible repositories,
without having to worry about installation paths, filenames, or
depenencies.

Plugin and script mata-data and version compatibilty are tracked, as are
dependencies on other plugins. The UI shows a pr√©cis of the functions
provided by a specific add-on, as well as notes by the author.

A companion plugin, PostInstall, is built in-tree, and distributed with
the main SPManager package. It cleans up temporary files occasionally
created by the installation processs.

This is a core plugin, distributed with the AOI core software in each
stable release.
