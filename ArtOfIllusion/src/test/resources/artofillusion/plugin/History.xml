    <description>
        A plugin for HID (Human Interface Devices).

        This plugin defines a new plugin category which models an HID. New HIDs can
        be supported simply by adding a new implementation of the HID interface.

        In effect, the HIDPlugin is the "master" plugin, and each separate Device
        sub-plugin is a device-driver for a particular piece of hardware.

        ** This plugin requires libraries and additional non-java files to
        provide hardware support. SPManager copies these to a location which should work(the "lib" folder), however you
        may need to copy these to a specific location
        to suit your Operating System
